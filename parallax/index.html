                is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of the objects that orbit the Sun 
                directly, the largest are the eight planets, with the remainder being smaller objects, 
                the dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the 
                Sun indirectly, the natural satellites, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.

                around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the planets in the 
                Solar System. It is named after the Greek god <i>Hermes (Ερμής)</i>, translated

                love and beauty. As the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after 
                the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be, on rare occasion, visible to the 
                naked eye in broad daylight. Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and so never 
                appears to venture far from the Sun, either setting in the west just after 
                dusk or rising in the east a little while before dawn. Venus orbits the Sun 
                every 224.7 Earth days.

                is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to 
                harbor life. About 29% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents 
                and islands. The remaining 71% is covered with water, mostly by oceans but 
                also by lakes, rivers, and other fresh water, which together constitute the 
                hydrosphere. Much of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice. Earth's outer 
                layer is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the 
                surface over many millions of years. Earth's interior remains active with a 
                solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates Earth's magnetic 
                field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.

                is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar 
                System, being larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of 
                the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the <i>"Red Planet"</i>. The 
                latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars's surface, 
                which gives it a reddish appearance distinctive among the astronomical bodies 
                visible to the naked eye. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, 
                with surface features reminiscent of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, 
                deserts and polar ice caps of Earth.

                The days and seasons are comparable to those of Earth, because the rotational 
                period as well as the tilt of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic 
                plane are similar.

                    Jupiter
                </a>
                is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a 
                gas giant with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times 
                that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is one of 
                the brightest objects visible to the naked eye in the night sky and has been 
                observed since pre-historic times. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter is on 
                average the third-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon and 
                Venus. It is named after the Roman god Jupiter. 
                <br><br>
                Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen, but helium comprises one quarter of its mass and one tenth of its 
                molecules. It may also have a rocky core of heavier elements, but like the other 
                giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. Because of its rapid 
                rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid (it has a slight but 
                noticeable bulge around the equator).

                    Saturn
                </a>
                is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, 
                after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine times 
                that of Earth. It only has one-eighth the average density of Earth. However, 
                with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive. Saturn is named 
                after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture. Its astronomical symbol (♄) 
                represents the god's sickle. The Romans named the seventh day of the week 
                Saturday, <i>Sāturni diēs</i> ("Saturn's Day") no later than the 2nd century 
                for the planet Saturn.
                <br><br>
                Saturn's interior is most likely composed of a core of iron–nickel and rock 
                (silicon and oxygen compounds). Its core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic 
                hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally a 
                gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper 
                atmosphere. An electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give 
                rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than the Earth's, but which has 
                a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic 
                field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's.

                    Uranus
                </a>
                is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the Greek god 
                of the sky, <i>Uranus</i>, who, according to Greek mythology, was the 
                grandfather of <i>Zeus (Jupiter)</i> and father of <i>Cronus (Saturn)</i>. It 
                has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in 
                the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have 
                bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of the larger gas giants 
                Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and 
                Neptune as <i>"ice giants"</i> to distinguish them from the other gas giants. 
                Uranus's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary 
                composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains more "ices" such as water, 
                ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons. It has the coldest 
                planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 
                <i>49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F)</i>, and has a complex, layered cloud structure with 
                water thought to make up the lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer of 
                clouds. The interior of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock. 
                <br><br>
                Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and numerous moons. 
                The Uranian system has a unique configuration because its axis of rotation is 
                tilted sideways, nearly into the plane of its solar orbit. Its north and south 
                poles, therefore, lie where most other planets have their equators.

                is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the Sun. In the Solar System, it is the 
                fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant 
                planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. 
                Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more 
                gravitational compression of its atmosphere. The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 
                years at an average distance of 30.1 AU (4.5 billion km; 2.8 billion mi). It is named 
                after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol ♆, a stylised version of 
                the god Neptune's trident.
