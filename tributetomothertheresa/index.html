            <p>Mother Mary Teresa Bojaxhiu, honoured in the Catholic Church as Saint Teresa 
                of Calcutta, was an Albanian-Indian Roman Catholic nun and missionary. 
                She was born in Skopje (now the capital of North Macedonia), then part of the 
                Kosovo Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire. After living in Skopje for eighteen years,
                she moved to Ireland and then to India, where she lived for most of her life.
                In <strong>1950</strong>, Teresa founded the Missionaries of Charity, a Roman 
                Catholic religious congregation that had over 4,500 nuns and was active in 133 
                countries in 2012. The congregation manages homes for people who are dying of 
                HIV/AIDS, leprosy and tuberculosis. It also runs soup kitchens, dispensaries, 
                mobile clinics, children's and family counselling programmes, as well as orphanages 
                and schools. Members take vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience, and also profess 
                a fourth vow – to give <strong>"wholehearted free service to the poorest of the poor."</strong>

                Mother Teresa received a number of honors, including the <strong> Ramon Magsaysay 
                Peace Prize and the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize</strong>. She was canonised on 
                4 September 2016, and the anniversary of her death (5 September) is her feast 
                day.
